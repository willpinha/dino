## 🦖 About

**Dino** is a lightweight HTTP library that contains utilities compatible with the `net/http` package

If you want to work directly with `net/http` and the standard library, without relying on abstractions (third-party routers, frameworks, etc.), but don't want to implement common functionalities from scratch, Dino is the right library for you

## 🦖 Philosophy

Dino doesn't try to be the magic solution that solves all your problems. Instead, it provides a thin layer built on top of `net/http` for functionalities commonly needed when building applications

It also follows the Go philosophy, which is to maintain simplicity and not apply breaking changes or major versions all the time. This makes Dino an easy-to-use and stable library in the long term

## 🦖 Installation

Want to try Dino? Go get the package below and start reading the next sections of the documentation

### Handlers

Handlers (a.k.a. Controllers) represents the core mechanism for processing HTTP requests and returning HTTP responses to the clients

Similar to the [http.HandlerFunc](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#HandlerFunc) type of `net/http`, a handler in Dino is a function, with the difference that this function returns an error. See below for an example of a handler:

```go
func MyHandler() dino.Handler {
    return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) error {
        // Handler logic here
        return nil
    }
}
```

Defining a custom handler that returns an error is a very common pattern because it simplifies error handling, as we will see in the following sections. This pattern is used, for example, on [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) and [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) handlers

### Routing

Dino's handlers implement the [`http.Handler`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Handler) interface, and therefore can be used anywhere that interface is used. An example of this is in [`http.ServeMux`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux):

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()

mux.Handle("GET /my/path", MyHandler())
mux.Handle("POST /another/path", AnotherHandler())
```

In fact, `http.ServeMux` is the ideal multiplexer (router) to use with Dino. This is because many of Dino's features are built upon the functionalities that `http.ServeMux` provides. Besides, it's part of the standard library and therefore a very stable router
