## About

**Dino** is a lightweight HTTP library that contains utilities compatible with the `net/http` package

If you want to work directly with `net/http` and the standard library, without relying on abstractions (third-party routers, frameworks, etc.), but don't want to implement common functionalities from scratch, Dino is the right library for you

## Philosophy

Dino doesn't try to be the magic solution that solves all your problems. Instead, it provides a thin layer built on top of `net/http` for functionalities commonly needed when building applications

It also follows the Go philosophy, which is to maintain simplicity and not apply breaking changes or major versions all the time. This makes Dino an easy-to-use and stable library in the long term
