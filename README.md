## About

Dino is a lightweight HTTP library that contains utilities compatible with the `net/http` package. If you want to work directly with `net/http` and the standard library, without relying on abstractions (third-party routers, frameworks, etc.), but don't want to implement common functionalities from scratch, Dino is the right library for you
